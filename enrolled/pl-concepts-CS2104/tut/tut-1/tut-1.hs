-- Tutorial 1 : Introduction to Haskell
-- Use GHCi (ghci in command line); this is not intended to be compiled by ghc.
-- Execute the lines of expressions one by one
-- The purpose of this tutorial is to familiarized yourself with Haskell

-- "Hello to Lab1/Tutorial1"
-- Goto: 
--   https://repl.it/languages/haskell
-- put this code in main.hs, and press 
--   run
--------------------------------------------
-- Q1 (Scope). Consider the expression below

import Prelude hiding (even,odd,pi)

x = 2

y = let x=3 in x+1

z = x+5

-- What are the values of x, y and z after the definition of z?
-- How many let definitions are there, and what are their scopes?

-- let x = x * 4 in x + y

-- Which x is being referenced in the last line?
-- What is the behavior of the last execution? Why?


---------------------------------------------
-- Q2 (Type). Consider the functions below

goo1 x y = x
goo2 x = \ y -> x
goo3 (x,y) = x

-- What are the types of these three functions?
-- You can check the type of expression in ghci, say of goo1, by :type goo1 or :t goo1.
-- Are these types general?
-- Give some examples of calls to these functions?
-- Describe in words what are the intentions of these functions?
-- How are these functions related to each other?

---------------------------------------------
-- Q3 (Type). Consider the function below

foo1 x = x + 1
foo2 x = x ++ " there"

-- What are the types of these two function?
-- Give some examples of valid arguments that can
--  be used by foo1 and foo2 methods?
--  e.g foo1 2.5, foo1 4, foo1 "hello"
-- What is [Char]? Is this the same as String?
-- You may get same information about type t using :info t

---------------------------------------------
-- Q4 (Type). Consider this set of mutual recursive functions
-- Take note that multi-line commands are entered in ghci with
-- the help of commands :{ and  :}

even :: Int -> Bool
even n = if n==0 then True else odd (n - 1)
odd :: Int -> Bool
odd n = if n==0 then False else even (n - 1)


-- Illustrate some valid calls to these functions, such as odd 3, even 3
-- Explain what happens when you have negative inputs to these functions?
-- What are the types of these functions?
-- Explain what happens when type declarations of form e::t 
--   are not provided. 

------------------------------------------
-- Q5. Consider the maxlist function below for a non-empty list of numbers.
-- take note that

maxlist [] = error "empty list";
maxlist (x:[]) = x;
maxlist (x:ys) = max x (maxlist ys)

--  maxlist [3,16,1]

-- (i) What is the type of this function?
-- (ii) Explain what happen when an empty list is supplied as the input?
-- (iii) Is it possible for recursive call, maxlist ys, in the third line
-- to throw an exception? Is it possible for ys to be []?

------------------------------------------
-- Q6. Rewrite maxlist function to use an auxiliary recursive
--     function, as follows:


maxlist2 xs =
     let aux xs sofar = 
          error "TBI - to be implemented"
     in
     case xs of
     [] -> error "empty list"
     (x:ys) -> aux ys x


-- maxlist2 [3,16,1]

-- How is this function different from the version in Q7
-- Is it better?

-------------------------------------------
-- Q7 : The maxlist function currently has type: [Int] -> Int.
--      Rewrite it to a version that is based on the following Maybe type.
--      data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

maxlist3 xs =
     case xs of
     [] -> Nothing;
     (x:[]) -> Just x;
     (x:ys) -> error "TBI - to be implemented"

-- The function 'show' converts a number into a string or [Char]
-- The function 'print' outputs any thing (almost) to the standard output
-- The function (++) concatenates two strings

-- print ("Q7a Ans (maxlist3 [3,16,1] = " ++ (show (maxlist3 [3,16,1])))
-- print ("Q7a Ans (maxlist3 [3,16,1] = " ++ (show (maxlist3 [])))

maxlist4 xs =
     let aux xs sofar =
          error "TBI - to be implemented"
     in
     case xs of
     [] -> Nothing;
     (x:ys) -> Just (aux ys x)


-- print ("Q7b Ans (maxlist4 [3,16,1] = " ++ (show (maxlist4 [3,16,1])))
-- print ("Q7b Ans (maxlist4 [3,16,1] = " ++ (show (maxlist4 [])))

-------------------------------------------
-- Q8 : Using function for abstraction.
-- Consider a simple code to compute the sum of 
-- the areas for three circles.
--
-- How would could you generalize the code 
-- to make it more abstract
-- so that it could compute the sum for an
-- arbitrary number of circules instead.
-- Hint : Use a list & use functions!

pi = 3.14159
r1 = 1.2 
r2 = 3.888
r3 = 10.0
three_circle = 2*pi*r1 + 2*pi*r2 * 2*pi*r3

-------------------------------------------
-- Q9 : Implement the Babylonian method for square root in
-- Haskell without using loops! Please use a recursive method
-- instead. What would be its expected type?

{-
Babylonian method for square root
Algorithm:
This method can be derived from (but predates) Newtonâ€“Raphson method.

1. Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the 
   root, the better).
2. Initialize y = 1.
3. Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
   a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
   b) Set y = n/x

Implementation in C:
/*Returns the square root of n. Note that the function */
float squareRoot(float n)
{
  /*We are using n itself as initial approximation
   This can definitely be improved */
  float x = n;
  float y = 1;
  float e = 0.000001; /* e decides the accuracy level*/
  while(x - y > e)
  {
    x = (x + y)/2;
    y = n/x;
  }
  return x;
}
/* Driver program to test above function*/
int main()
{
  int n = 50;
  printf ("Square root of %d is %f", n, squareRoot(n));
  getchar();
}
Running on IDE
Example:
n = 4 /*n itself is used for initial approximation*/
Initialize x = 4, y = 1
Next Approximation x = (x + y)/2 (= 2.500000), 
y = n/x  (=1.600000)
Next Approximation x = 2.050000,
y = 1.951220
Next Approximation x = 2.000610,
y = 1.999390
Next Approximation x = 2.000000, 
y = 2.000000
Terminate as (x - y) > e now.
